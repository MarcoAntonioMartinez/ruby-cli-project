# Ruby CLI Project - Distance Calculator

- This program takes two cities and outputs the distance between them. This is useful to know how long it takes to go from point A to point B.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to know how long it will take for me to go from the city I live in to my destination, so that I can plan my trip.

## Functional Requirements
- The distance calculator must prompt the user for a starting city and a ending city. 
- The distance calculator must display the distance from the starting city to the ending city.
- The distance calculator must handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., anything that is not listed in the prompt for user input).
